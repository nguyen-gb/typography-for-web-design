# Web Design Font Pairing

Font pairing is a great way to create contrast, balance, and harmony in your designs. Here are some suggested font pairs for different website elements.

## Headings vs. Body Text
1. **Roboto (Heading) / Open Sans (Body)**
   - Modern and clean, this pairing will work for technology and business sites.
2. **Playfair Display (Heading) / Lato (Body)**
   - A mix of serif and sans-serif, yields a professional yet classy outcome.

3. **Montserrat (Heading) + Georgia (Body)**
   - It will be perfect for websites that require a vintage or editorial feel, since it is bold and classic.

## Button Text
1. **Arial (Button) + Verdana (Body)**
   - Clean, Simple, web-safe combination works best for effective call-to-actions.

2. **Raleway (Button) + Open Sans (Body)**
   - Smoothening the design, Raleway goes along with Open Sans in modern and minimalistic sites.
