# Accessible Fonts for Web Design

These are suggested fonts that are typefaces designed to be more readable by individuals who have visual disabilities or dyslexia when designing for accessibility.

## Recommended Accessible Fonts
1. **Verdana**
	- Verdana is known for wide spacing and readability, making it a safe choice for body text on most websites.
	
2. **Arial**
	- Arial is a classic sans-serif type font, readable on small screens and large displays.

3. **Roboto**
	- Optimized for mobile, the Roboto font lends to super readability at very small sizes, on all devices.

4. **Dyslexie**
	- As this font was specially made for people who have dyslexia, Dyslexie helps in making it easier on dyslexic readers while trying to read the text.

## Font Size and Line Height
  - **Minimum font size of the body**: 16px.
  - **Line height**: 1.5 or 150% of the font size, so that it is more readable.
